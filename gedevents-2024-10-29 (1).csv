A bomb explosion, which took place on a racecourse in Nalchik, killed one and injured twenty people.

""Having an experience of work in the law-enforcement agencies, I am convinced that this was a direct attempt on the life of the head of the republic, Arsen Kanokov - the main guarantor of stability in the Kabarda-Balkaria Republic,"" the website quoted Shkhagoshev as saying.

He noted that President Kanokov traditionally attended horse races on 1 May every year and that whoever conceived the terrorist act, had assumed that he would attend this year as well. He added that the time-bomb had been installed on the VIP lounge.

""This terrorist attack, just like the explosion of a patrol car in the Kabarda-Balkaria capital two days ago, is the work of badly organized groups. These separate provocative attacks do not have either former force or support now. 'Guerrilla' warfare has been declared on the law-enforcement agencies, to which our law enforcement bodies are not ready,"" the MP said, calling on citizens of the republic to demonstrate ""vigilance and right understanding"" of the situation.
